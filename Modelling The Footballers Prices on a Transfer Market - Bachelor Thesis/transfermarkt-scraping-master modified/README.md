# transfermarkt.co.uk scraping

### This script aims at collecting performance information on football players from the website [transfermarkt.co.uk](www.transfermarkt.co.uk).

#### It focuses on offensive players and stores goals and assists over the last 5 years for all players from the 10 main European leagues.

#### The parsing is done hierarchically with a tree fashion: leagues -> teams -> players. The output is stored in csv format.

#### Shared on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gimunu/football-striker-performance).
